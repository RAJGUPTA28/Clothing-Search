# Semantic Search with Pinecone Database

![Semantic Search](path_to_image)

This repository contains an implementation of semantic search using the Pinecone database. It leverages the Sentence Transformer library, Pinecone client, and NLTK for natural language processing.

## Semantic Search

Semantic search is a technique used to retrieve information based on the meaning or context rather than relying solely on keyword matching. It aims to understand the intent behind a query and retrieve relevant results that are semantically similar.

In this project, we use the Sentence Transformer model to encode sentences into dense vectors that capture the semantic meaning. The `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model from SentenceTransformer is used for this purpose. It is a pre-trained language model fine-tuned on a large corpus of text data.

## Pinecone Database

[Pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/) is a vector database that provides a scalable and efficient solution for similarity search. It allows us to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors, making it ideal for semantic search tasks.
